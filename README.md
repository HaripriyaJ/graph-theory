Algorithms planned to be implemented:
-------------------------------------


1) Connectedness and Components
  ------------------------------
    Giving input of graph as adjacency matrix.
    Perform fusion on vertices that are adjacent.
    Connected graph will reduce to single vertex.
    Connected components will remain as rows in adjacency matrix.
    Display the number of components ie, count of no.of rows.
