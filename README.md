Algorithms planned to be implemented:

1) Connectedness and Components
  ------------------------------
    Giving input of grapg as adjacency matrix.
    Perform fusion on vertices that are adjacent.
    Connected components will result in a single vertex else will remain as such.
    Display the number of components.
